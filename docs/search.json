Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden until it is expanded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip With Caption\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Collapse\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a ‘folded’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use collapse=\"true\" to collapse it by default or collapse=\"false\" to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
